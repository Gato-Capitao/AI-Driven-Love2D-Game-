## Description
In this project, players encounter a modified version of the familiar Flappy Bird gameplay. However, what sets this project apart is its integration with machine learning algorithms. The game serves as a testing ground to evaluate whether machine learning techniques can effectively learn and perform well in a dynamic and challenging gaming environment.
